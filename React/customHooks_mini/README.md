# Currency Converter – React Learning Project

This is a **React learning project** demonstrating how to:

- Use **React Hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useId`.
- Create and use **custom hooks** (`useCurrencyInfo`) for fetching and managing API data.
- Call **external APIs** to retrieve live currency exchange rates.
- Pass props and handle events between parent and child components (`App` → `InputBox`).
- Work with **state updates**, **form handling**, and **conditional rendering**.
- Apply **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive layouts.

## Key Features
- **Real-time currency conversion** using the [@fawazahmed0/currency-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api).
- **Swap functionality** to quickly exchange "From" and "To" currencies.
- **Reusable InputBox component** for amount and currency selection.
- **Dynamic currency options** populated from API data.
- **Custom Hook (`useCurrencyInfo`)** for clean data-fetching logic.

## Tech Stack
- **React** – UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling
- **Custom Hooks** – Data fetching and state management
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Currency API** – Live exchange rate data

This project serves as a practical example of structuring React components, managing state, and integrating APIs while keeping the code modular and reusable.
