# React Context API Learning Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey in React, specifically focusing on **Context API** for state management.  

It contains the following main components:  

- **`App.jsx`** – The main application component that wraps the app with the Context Provider, allowing global state to be shared across components.
- **`Login.jsx`** – A component that simulates user login, updating the shared state using Context.
- **`Profile.jsx`** – A component that consumes the shared state from Context to display user information after login.

The goal of this project was to understand:
- How to create and use a Context in React.
- How to provide and consume data globally without prop drilling.
- How components interact through a shared state.
