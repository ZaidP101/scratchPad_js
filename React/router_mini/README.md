# React Router Mini Project

This project was created as part of learning **React Router**.  
It demonstrates how to use a **Layout** component with the `Outlet` feature so that the **Header** and **Footer** remain the same across pages while the content in between changes dynamically.

  - GitHub profile avatar

  Modern and responsive UI design using Tailwind.
