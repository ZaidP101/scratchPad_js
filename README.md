# Exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Through Creative Projects

In this Git repository, I've explored various aspects of web development by working on fun and educational mini-projects. These projects are part of my personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Shape Creations

In this project, I experimented with creating different shapes using HTML and CSS. It's a simple yet effective way to understand how CSS properties can be manipulated to achieve various visual effects.

## Project 1: Hover Effects

This mini-project focuses on hover effects. When you hover your cursor over the shapes, their colors change, providing an interactive experience. It's a demonstration of how CSS transitions can enhance user interactions.

## Project 2: DevOps Roadmap Cards

In this project, I've designed a set of cards that, when hovered over, bring the images to the top of the deck. These images represent a roadmap for beginners in DevOps, offering a visual guide to get started.

## Project 3: Interactive Square Elements

This project features interactive square elements that respond to mouse events. Each square has unique behaviors on hover and click, demonstrating the use of JavaScript to create dynamic and engaging web interactions.

- **Square 1:** Displays a random number on hover and reverts to "1" when the mouse leaves.
- **Square 2:** Toggles between red and green backgrounds with text color changes on hover.
- **Square 3:** Changes to a random background color on hover with contrasting text color.
- **Square 4:** On click, changes the background color of all squares and itself to various colors, and displays "Again!!". Reverts to original colors and text on mouse leave.

## Project 4: Dynamic Image Cards

In this project, I've created a dynamic gallery of image cards using JavaScript. Each card is randomly assigned an image from a predefined set of DevOps-related icons.

### Features

- **Random Image Assignment:** Each card displays a randomly selected image.
- **Dynamic Content Generation:** JavaScript is used to dynamically create and insert 44 image cards into the webpage.
- **Refresh for New Images:** Refresh the page to get a new random layout.
- **Image Gallery:** Set of 44 dynamically generated cards.

## Project 5: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game uses DOM manipulation to update the board, check for wins or draws, and display appropriate messages.

### Features

- Two-player functionality (Player X and Player O).
- Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
- Draw detection.
- Option to restart and play again.

## Project 6: Number Guessing Game

In this project, the computer generates a random number, and the player gets **10 tries** to guess it.

### Features

- Enter your guess and receive hints whether the guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- All guesses are added to a visible **queue**.
- If the correct number is guessed within 10 tries, the player wins!
- If the player fails, the correct answer is revealed at the end.

This game helped me practice **input handling**, **loops**, and **DOM updates** dynamically.

## Project 7: Keyboard Event Display

This mini-project captures **keyboard events** and displays:

- The **key** pressed
- The **keyCode**
- The **code** corresponding to the key

This real-time display of key data helped me understand **event listeners** and **dynamic content rendering** with JavaScript.
